    // To use jQuery, we call the "jQuery" function, passing in the CSS selector
    // for the element we want to select as a string (don't do anything with it yet):
    var bug = jQuery("#bug");
    // "bug" is now a jQuery object that represents our <img> tag in the HTML,
    // not to be confused with the <img> tag's id - we use the id named "bug"
    // to create a jQuery object, which is assigned to the javascript variable
    // also named "bug"
