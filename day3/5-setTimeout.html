    // We've now moved the code for changing the bug's CSS into its own function.
    // Remember, a function is a way to bundle commands together and run them all.
    //
    // Functions accept parameters, which are variables you can pass into the function
    // when you call it that can affect what the function does.
    //
    // Functions, like numbers, booleans, and strings, and arrays, can be stored
    // in variables and passed around - in this case, we're creating a function and
    // saving it in the variable "updateBugStyles".
    var updateBugStyles = function() {
        // Functions can use variables that were declared at the same place that
        // the function itself was declared, so we can use the "bug" variable
        // here.
        bug.css("left", 400);
        bug.css("border", "4px dashed blue");
    };

    // We can run a function by writing the function name,
    // followed by an open parentheses,
    // followed by the parameters to pass,
    // followed by a close parentheses.
    //
    // We've been doing this already! "jQuery" is just a function!
    // bug.css is also just another function



    // Now we're going to introduce the setTimeout function.
    // setTimeout is special in that it asks for *another function*
    // as one of its parameters. setTimeout will run the function
    // that you've given it after some number of milliseconds
    // which is the second parameter.
    //
    // a function which is passed into another function, to be called
    // by that other function sometime later, is a *callback*.
    setTimeout(updateBugStyles, 2000);
